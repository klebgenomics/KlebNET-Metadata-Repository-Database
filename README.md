# KlebNET-Metadata-Repository

The KlebNET Metadata Repository houses curated metadata describing publicly available _Klebsiella_ whole genome sequences. It is the product of a community-driven curation effort aimed at enhancing the usability and reusability of public genome collections for maximum knowledge gain. These efforts focus on _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and its close relatives within the _K. pneumoniae_ Species Complex (KpSC), and are coordinated by the [KlebNET-GSP](https://klebnet.org/) project team.

This open-access repository has been initiated and is supported by the KlebNET-GSP Epidemiology Consortium, coordinated by A/Prof Kelly Wyres (Monash University, Australia) on behalf of [KlebNET-GSP](https://klebnet.org/). Membership in the consortium requires contributing contextual metadata to this repository. If you wish to join, please read the [terms of reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12wuWxgucGVYnnKHZ8xvDCVLQhV0tEafCb2CuxClw0Hw/edit?usp=sharing) and complete the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9yoXfh0MP_tqvWh7RqxFKXr30MMAQkeZ_sxhEPyIsQX43dQ/viewform?usp=header). We may contact you in the future to enquire about the KpSC metadata you can provide.

## Data reuse policy

The KlebNET Metadata Repository is available for secondary analysis in accordance with the principles of the [PHA4GE Microbial Data Sharing Accord](https://pha4ge.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PHA4GE_Microbial_Data_Sharing_Accord_v1.0.pdf), with the following exceptions:

-	**Clause 3** (Onward sharing of data): Inclusion of this database in external platforms is permitted, provided this statement is included.
- **Clause 2** (Overview of outputs prior to publication)*: Applies only to a subset of the data where this clause has been waived by the data contributor
- **Clause 7** (Opportunity for collaboration): Also applies only to a subset of the data where this clause has been waived by the data contributor


The `PHA4GE accord` column indicates the clauses that apply to each isolate record in the Repository:

- `PHA4GE v1.0 -3` indicates that PHA4GE accord version 1.0 applies with the exclusion of Clause 3

- `PHA4GE v1.0 -3,-2` indicates that PHA4GE accord version 1.0 applies with the exclusion of Clause 3 and Clause 2

- `PHA4GE v1.0 -3,-7` indicates that PHA4GE accord version 1.0 applies with the exclusion of Clause 3 and Clause 7

- `PHA4GE v1.0 -3,-2,-7` indicates that PHA4GE accord version 1.0 applies with the exclusion of Clause 3, Clause 2 and Clause 7.

## Working with the Repository

The data are tabulated and stored as a tab-delimited text file (.tsv) that can be read and manipulated with common data analysis platforms such as Python and R, and can be imported into spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets (we recommend using the 'import data' function, where you can specify that the data are tab-delimited). 

Each row in the table represents a distinct whole genome sequence of a KpSC isolate. Column definitions are described in the [Klebsiella genome metadata scheme](https://github.com/klebgenomics/Klebsiella-genome-metadata).

## Contribute to the Repository

We welcome contributions from data generators globally. If you would like to contribute to the Klebsiella Metadata Repository, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/klebgenomics/Klebsiella-genome-metadata/blob/main/README.md#data-submission).
