# KlebNET-Metadata-Repository-Database

The KlebNET Metadata Repository Database houses metadata associated with publicly available _Klebsiella_ whole genome sequences. It is the result of a community-driven data curation effort to facilitate the use and reuse of public genome collections for maximum knowledge gain. These efforts are focussed on _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and closely related organisms in the _K. pneumoniae_ Species Complex (KpSC) and are coordinated by the [KlebNET-GSP](https://klebnet.org/) project team. 

## Data reuse policy

The KlebNET Metadata Repository Database is available for secondary analysis according to the principles of the [PHA4GE Microbial Data Sharing Accord](https://pha4ge.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PHA4GE_Microbial_Data_Sharing_Accord_v1.0.pdf), with the exception of Clause 3: Onward sharing of data as inclusion of this database in external platforms is allowed so long as this statement is included; exception of Clause 2: Overview of Outputs prior to Publication which is required for only a subset of the data; and exception of Clause 7: Opportunity for Collaboration which is required for only a subset of data. 

The `PHA4GE accord` column indicates the clauses that apply to each isolate represented in the Respoitory:
- `PHA4GE v1.0 -3` indicates that PHA4GE accord version 1.0 applies with the exclusion of clause 3
- `PHA4GE v1.0 -3,-2` indicates that PHA4GE accord version 1.0 applies with the exclusion of clauses 3 and 2
- `PHA4GE v1.0 -3,-7` indicates that PHA4GE accord version 1.0 applies with the exclusion of clauses 3 and 7
- `PHA4GE v1.0 -3,-2,-7` indicates that PHA4GE accord version 1.0 applies with the exclusion of clauses 3, 2 and 7.

## Working with the Repository

The data are tabulated and stored as a tab-delimited text file that can be read and maniputlated with common data processing packagaes such as Python and R, and can be imported into spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets (we recommend using the import data function, where you can specify that the data are tab-delimited).

Column definitions are described in the associated [scheme repository](https://github.com/klebgenomics/Klebsiella-genome-metadata).

## Contribute to the Repository

We welcome contributions from data generators globally. If you would like to contribute data, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/klebgenomics/Klebsiella-genome-metadata/blob/main/README.md#data-submission).
